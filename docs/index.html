				<p class="description">The purpose of our project is to find how climate change and the ocean affect each other and the relationship between the two. To do this, we’ve studied corals. Corals provide vital information about the ocean as they are essentially records of decades worth of ocean data. Much like how tree rings show how much rainfall each year had, the ratio of strontium to calcium on coral layers can be used to calculate the temperature throughout the years. We’ve also applied the usage of Keeling Curves. Keeling curves show us the amount of carbon dioxide measured in the Earth’s atmosphere from 1958 to present day. With information about strontium calcium ratios and carbon dioxide amounts, we plotted the relationship between these two datasets for two locations, Vietnam and the Philippines. Please look through our findings below!

							<p class="description">All our data was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We used two datasets, one that is monthly sr/ca ratio and the other is global carbon dioxide emissions over time. Our data gives the time (in terms of years and months), Sr/Ca ratio (the coral’s chemistry), and CO2 emissions. 

Sr/Ca is a proxy for temperature, in order to find the temperature from Sr/Ca ratios we used linear regression. The linear regression equation has the format of Y= a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable (y on the axis), X is the independent variable ( X on the axis), b is the slope of the line and a is the y-intercept. Using the linear regression equation we were able to determine that the SST and Sr/Ca ratio had a negative slope which means that as the temperature goes increasing the Sr/Ca ratio is dropping . 

(we used a publish linear equation shown below Ramos et al., 2019)

Sr/Ca = 10.790 - 0.068 X SST (°C)

We plugged in the data into the equation so that the 10.790 is a, - 0.068 is b and SST (°C) is X. 
We used our Sr/Ca data and subtracted it from 10.790. Then, we divided the difference with -0.068. We were able to organize our data monthly and chart by indexing. After that, we opened another file that had our CO2 data. Finally, we were able to use both our charts and combine them into one graph showing the Sea Surface Temperature and CO2 throughout the years.
Coding section:
Step 1: We imported our Python libraries -  numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and os. 
Step 2: Next, we wrote down the path to our data files and used the method os.chdir. Then, we read our data and eliminated all the unnecessary data and converted the data into a chart. After that, we converted our “age_AD” column to years and months. Once we had our years and months, we rounded them to the nearest whole number. In order to do this, we used the method np.floor. In addition, we also had to use the method np.ceiling to get the months. Once we have both our months and years, we find the temperature. In order to find the Sea Surface Temperature, we used linear regression. Once we have our SST listed, we index our chart to make the chart more organized. Finally, we used the method plt.twinx to create a graph that includes the years, SST, and CO2.

						This graph shows the amount of CO2 and the sea surface temperature over a 30 year period in the Philippines. Here, the amount of carbon dioxide increased at a steady rate, not having any spikes or drops in amount. The sea surface temperature, conversely, is not consistent at all and has rapid increases and decreases frequently.  However, what can be seen is that despite the SST and CO2’s large disparity inconsistency, both have increased over the 30 year time period, albeit CO2 increased much more clearly than the SST.

					<p class="text">
						We used the keeling curve here to show the increase of CO2. The curve proves how carbon dioxide has been steadily increasing over time. The Keeling curve is plotted with sea surface temperature data. SST increases and decreases many times over the 30 year period and does not have an overall increase or decrease over the time period. There is no visible relation between the SST and CO2 amounts, so it can be concluded that SST and CO2 have little to no relation to each other.
