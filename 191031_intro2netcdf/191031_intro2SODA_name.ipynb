    "## Introduction to the SODA dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For our research, we will be working with a dataset of ocean conditions called SODA or Simple Ocean Data Assimilation. This data combines experimental measurements of the ocean with modelled data to map out ocean conditions across the globe. The oceans are huge (almost 70% of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans) so it very difficult to get oceanographic measurements of every inch of it. Scientists instead use models based on their understanding of what influences the oceans to fill in the gaps in their measurements. They can also use models to go back in time to look at what oceans might have been like in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in SODA is saved as a grid kind of like this where every grid point is a measurement of a particular ocean condition like sea surface temperature.\n",
